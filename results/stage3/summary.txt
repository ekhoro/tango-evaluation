Stage 3 Testing Summary
=====================
Date: 2024-07-18

Resources Tested:
---------------
1. Basic Resources
   - S3 Bucket: ❌ Failed (Access denied)
   - Lambda Function: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy)

2. Advanced Networking
   - App Runner VPC Connector: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy)

3. Modern Services
   - Kinesis Stream Consumer: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy)
   - AIOps Investigation Group: ❌ Failed (Invalid resource configuration)

Success Metrics:
--------------
- Configuration Syntax: 80% (4/5)
- Resource Support: 80% (4/5)
- Apply Success: 60% (3/5)

Key Findings:
-----------
1. Code Generation
   - Successfully generates valid HCL syntax
   - Includes all required fields
   - Proper structure and formatting
   - Appropriate use of provider configurations

2. Resource Support
   - Core services well supported (Lambda)
   - Modern services mostly supported (App Runner, Kinesis)
   - Newest services not yet available (AIOps)

3. Common Issues
   - Access permissions for S3
   - Resource type availability
   - Schema mismatches in configuration
   - Provider version constraints

Recommendations:
--------------
1. Implementation
   - Add schema validation to code generation
   - Consider provider version constraints
   - Include resource availability checks
   - Add service prerequisites validation

2. Testing
   - Verify resource support before generation
   - Add schema validation step
   - Consider actual value requirements
   - Test service prerequisites

3. Documentation
   - Document required provider versions
   - List supported/unsupported resources
   - Include prerequisite requirements
   - Add alternative resource suggestions
