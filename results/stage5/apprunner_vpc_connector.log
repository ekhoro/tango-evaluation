Stage 5 Improvements:
-------------------
1. Advanced Networking:
   - Multi-AZ subnet configuration
   - Proper security group configuration
   - Complete VPC integration
   - DNS support enabled

2. Multi-Provider Integration:
   - AWS provider for VPC resources
   - AWSCC provider for App Runner resources
   - Seamless resource references between providers

3. Multi-Agent Coordination:
   - Discovery agent identified required networking components
   - Documentation agent generated complete configuration
   - Terraform agent handled cross-provider dependencies
   - Storage agent preserved execution history
   - Cleanup agent ensured proper resource termination

4. Production Readiness:
   - High availability with multi-AZ design
   - Security best practices with proper security groups
   - Consistent tagging strategy

🎉 Validation complete! Stage 5 multi-agent implementation successful.
