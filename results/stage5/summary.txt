Stage 5 Testing Summary
=====================
Date: 2025-07-22

Resources Tested:
---------------
1. Basic Resources
   - S3 Bucket: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy with dynamic naming)
   - Lambda Function: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy with inline code)

2. Advanced Networking
   - App Runner VPC Connector: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy with multi-AZ setup)

3. Modern Services
   - Kinesis Stream Consumer: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy with stream integration)
   - AIOps Investigation Group: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy with IAM policies)

Success Metrics:
--------------
- Configuration Syntax: 100% (5/5)
- Resource Support: 100% (5/5)
- Apply Success: 100% (5/5)

Key Findings:
-----------
1. Code Generation
   - Specialized agent collaboration for comprehensive solutions
   - Dynamic resource naming with random suffixes
   - Proper multi-provider integration
   - Advanced security configurations

2. Resource Support
   - Complete support for all tested resources
   - Advanced service integration (AIOps, Kinesis)
   - Multi-AZ configurations for high availability
   - Proper IAM role and policy management

3. Common Issues
   - Resource creation timing dependencies
   - IAM policy propagation delays
   - Cross-service integration complexity
   - Resource cleanup sequencing

Recommendations:
--------------
1. Implementation
   - Implement resource dependency tracking
   - Add IAM policy propagation handling
   - Enhance cross-service integration
   - Improve resource cleanup sequencing

2. Testing
   - Test complex resource dependencies
   - Verify IAM policy propagation
   - Validate cross-service integration
   - Ensure complete resource cleanup

3. Documentation
   - Document resource dependencies
   - Include IAM policy requirements
   - Detail cross-service integration patterns
   - Provide resource cleanup guidance
