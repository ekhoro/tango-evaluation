Stage 2 S3 Bucket Test Results
==========================
Date: 2024-07-17

Test Sequence Summary:
-------------------
1. Configuration Validation
   ✅ Terraform init successful
   ✅ Provider initialization successful
   ✅ Configuration syntax valid

2. Plan Generation
   ✅ Plan created successfully
   - Planned: 2 to add (bucket and random_id)
   - All required fields present
   - Variables properly configured
   - Resource dependencies correct

3. Apply Attempt
   ✅ Successfully created bucket
   - Random ID generation worked
   - Bucket name: awscc-example-6db25cad
   - All configurations applied correctly

Improvements from Stage 1:
-----------------------
1. Variable Usage:
   - Region configuration
   - Bucket prefix with random suffix
   - Configurable features (versioning, public access)
   - Lifecycle policy parameters
   - Environment and stage tags

2. Enhanced Security:
   - Default private access
   - Encryption enabled by default
   - Versioning enabled by default
   - Configurable lifecycle policies

3. Better Structure:
   - Clear variable definitions
   - Descriptive output blocks
   - Organized resource blocks
   - Consistent naming

4. Resource Management:
   - Random ID for unique naming
   - Proper lifecycle rules
   - Tag management
   - Resource outputs

Next Steps:
----------
- Test bucket accessibility
- Verify lifecycle policies
- Check encryption settings
- Consider cleanup (terraform destroy)
Cleanup Results:
--------------
✅ Terraform destroy successful
- S3 bucket removed: awscc-example-6db25cad
- Random ID resource cleaned up
- All associated configurations removed
- No errors during cleanup
