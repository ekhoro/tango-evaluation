Stage 2 Testing Summary
=====================
Date: 2024-07-18

Resources Tested:
---------------
1. Basic Resources
   - S3 Bucket: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy)
   - Lambda Function: ✅ Success (Valid config, successful apply/destroy)

2. Advanced Networking
   - App Runner VPC Connector: ❌ Failed (Invalid resource types for VPC components)

3. Modern Services
   - Kinesis Stream Consumer: ❌ Failed (Resource not supported)
   - AIOps Investigation Group: ❌ Failed (Resource not supported)

Success Metrics:
--------------
- Configuration Syntax: 100% (5/5)
- Resource Support: 40% (2/5)
- Apply Success: 40% (2/5)

Key Findings:
-----------
1. Code Generation
   - Successfully generates valid HCL syntax
   - Includes all required fields
   - Proper structure and formatting
   - Appropriate use of variables and dependencies

2. Resource Support
   - Core services well supported (S3, Lambda)
   - Modern services partially supported (App Runner)
   - Newest services not yet available (AIOps, Kinesis features)

3. Common Issues
   - Resource type availability in provider
   - Schema mismatches in configuration
   - Provider version constraints
   - Service prerequisites documentation

Recommendations:
--------------
1. Implementation
   - Add schema validation to code generation
   - Consider provider version constraints
   - Include resource availability checks
   - Add service prerequisites validation

2. Testing
   - Verify resource support before generation
   - Add schema validation step
   - Consider actual value requirements
   - Test service prerequisites

3. Documentation
   - Document required provider versions
   - List supported/unsupported resources
   - Include prerequisite requirements
   - Add alternative resource suggestions
