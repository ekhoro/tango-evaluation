Stage 2 App Runner VPC Connector Test Results
=========================================
Date: 2024-07-17

Test Sequence Summary:
-------------------
1. Configuration Validation
   ❌ Failed validation
   Error: Invalid resource type "awscc_ec2_securitygroup"
   Error: Reference to undeclared resource "awscc_ec2_security_group"

2. Generated Configuration Analysis:
   a. Resource Structure:
      - Random ID generation ✅
      - VPC creation included ✅
      - Multiple subnets in different AZs ✅
      - Security group configuration ❌ (incorrect resource type)
      - VPC Connector configuration ✅

   b. Variable Management:
      - Region configuration ✅
      - Resource prefix handling ✅
      - Environment settings ✅
      - Stage configuration ✅
      - CIDR block management ✅

   c. Naming and Tagging:
      - Consistent naming pattern ✅
      - Environment tags ✅
      - Stage tags ✅
      - Resource-specific tags ✅

3. Stage 2 Requirements Coverage:
   - Provider constraints ✅
   - Variable usage ✅
   - Resource dependencies ✅
   - Naming conventions ❌ (incorrect for security group)
   - Supporting resources ✅
   - Schema validation ❌ (failed)

Issues Identified:
----------------
1. Resource Type Errors:
   - Incorrect: awscc_ec2_securitygroup
   - Incorrect: awscc_ec2_security_group
   - These resources are not supported by AWS Cloud Control provider

2. Schema Validation:
   - Security group attributes don't match provider schema
   - Resource naming doesn't follow Cloud Control conventions

3. Dependencies:
   - VPC and subnet resources appear correct
   - Security group resource prevents full validation

Improvements from Stage 1:
-----------------------
1. Infrastructure Completeness:
   - Added complete VPC setup
   - Included multiple availability zones
   - Added security group configuration
   - Proper resource dependencies

2. Variable Management:
   - More flexible configuration
   - Environment-aware setup
   - Stage-based deployment
   - Better resource naming

3. Documentation:
   - Clear resource relationships
   - Structured configuration
   - Comprehensive variable definitions

Next Steps:
----------
- Verify correct resource types in AWS Cloud Control provider
- Update security group configuration
- Validate schema requirements
- Test with correct resource types
