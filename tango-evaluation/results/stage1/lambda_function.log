Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
‚úÖ Terraform initialization successful

üîß Validating configuration...
Success! The configuration is valid.

‚úÖ Terraform validation successful

üìã Generating plan...
‚úÖ Terraform plan successful

üìÑ Plan summary:
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

üéâ Validation complete! Your Terraform file is ready to use.

Next steps:
1. Review the generated plan
2. Apply with: terraform apply
3. Don't forget to clean up with: terraform destroy

Analysis and Observations:
========================
Date: 2024-07-17

Test Sequence Summary:
-------------------
1. Configuration Validation
   ‚úÖ Terraform init successful
   ‚úÖ Provider initialization successful
   ‚úÖ Configuration syntax valid

2. Plan Generation
   ‚úÖ Plan created successfully
   - Planned: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy
   - All required fields present
   - Environment variables included
   - Tags properly formatted

3. Apply Attempt
   ‚ùå Failed during resource creation
   Error: "Cross-account pass role is not allowed"
   Root Cause: Placeholder IAM role ARN used (123456789012)

Observations:
------------
1. Generated code quality:
   - Correct resource structure
   - All required fields included
   - Proper formatting and organization
   - Includes optional configurations (env vars, tags)

2. Stage 1 effectiveness:
   - Successfully generated valid Terraform syntax
   - Included necessary provider configuration
   - Created complete resource definition
   - Used appropriate placeholder values

3. Validation results:
   - Code passes terraform validation
   - Fails at actual resource creation (expected with placeholder values)
   - Error messages are clear and actionable

Next Steps:
-----------
- Move on to testing next resource
- Note that placeholder values need replacement for actual deployment
- Consider this a successful Stage 1 test as code structure is valid
