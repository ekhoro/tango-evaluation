Stage 1 Testing Summary
=====================
Date: 2024-07-17

Resources Tested:
---------------
1. awscc_s3_bucket (Basic Storage)
   - ❌ Failed validation
   - Error: Incorrect attribute value type for "access_control"
   - Issue: Schema mismatch in configuration

2. awscc_lambda_function (Serverless Compute)
   - ✅ Configuration valid
   - ✅ Plan successful
   - ❌ Apply failed
   - Error: Cross-account pass role not allowed
   - Issue: Placeholder IAM role ARN

3. awscc_apprunner_vpc_connector (Modern VPC Integration)
   - ✅ Configuration valid
   - ✅ Plan successful
   - ❌ Apply failed
   - Error: Failed to get subnets details
   - Issue: Placeholder subnet IDs

4. awscc_kinesis_stream_consumer (Real-time Data Processing)
   - ❌ Failed validation
   - Error: Resource type not supported by provider
   - Issue: Resource not available in current provider version

5. awscc_aiops_investigation_group (AI Operations)
   - ❌ Failed validation
   - Error: Resource type not supported by provider
   - Issue: Resource not available in current provider version

Overall Analysis:
---------------
Success Rates:
- Configuration Syntax: 2/5 (40%)
- Resource Support: 3/5 (60%)
- Apply Attempts: 0/5 (0%)

Key Findings:
1. Code Generation:
   - Successfully generates valid HCL syntax
   - Includes all required fields
   - Proper structure and formatting
   - Appropriate use of placeholder values

2. Resource Support:
   - Core services well supported (S3, Lambda)
   - Modern services partially supported (App Runner)
   - Newest services not yet available (AIOps, some Kinesis features)

3. Common Issues:
   - Schema mismatches in configuration
   - Placeholder values causing expected failures
   - Resource type availability in provider

Recommendations:
--------------
1. Implementation:
   - Add schema validation to code generation
   - Consider provider version constraints
   - Include resource availability checks

2. Testing:
   - Verify resource support before generation
   - Add schema validation step
   - Consider actual value requirements

3. Documentation:
   - Document required provider versions
   - List supported/unsupported resources
   - Include placeholder value guidance
